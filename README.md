# Solar System Simulation

## Overview

This project is a real-time simulation of the solar system, implemented in C++ with OpenGL and GLFW. The simulation includes three rotating cubes representing the Sun, Moon, and Earth, each with realistic rotational and orbital movements.

## Key Features

1. **Realistic Orbital Movements:**
   - The Earth cube orbits the Sun cube while rotating on its own axis, simulating Earth's rotation and revolution around the Sun.
   - The Moon cube orbits the Earth, replicating the Moon's natural movement in relation to our planet.

2. **OpenGL and GLFW Integration:**
   - Utilized OpenGL for graphics rendering, implementing shaders for visually appealing representations of celestial bodies.
   - GLFW used for window creation and management, providing a stable and cross-platform framework for user input and display.

3. **Graphics and Vector Mathematics:**
   - Explored 3D graphics principles, understanding how to represent objects in space and manipulate their positions and orientations.
   - Applied vector and matrix mathematics to model the movement and rotations of the cubes.

4. **Rendering Techniques:**
   - Implemented shading, lighting, and textures to enhance the visual aspects of the simulation.
   - Experimented with various OpenGL features for realistic lighting effects and simulating reflective properties.

## Learning Outcomes

This project has been instrumental in advancing my knowledge and skills in graphics programming:
- Strengthened understanding of vector and matrix mathematics.
- Honed skills in OpenGL rendering, shading, and lighting.
- Gained insights into simulating real-world phenomena in a virtual environment.
